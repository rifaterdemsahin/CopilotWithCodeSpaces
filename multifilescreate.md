# Multi-File Creation with GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot can assist you in creating multiple files for your project. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Open Your Project**: Ensure you have your project open in your code editor (e.g., VS Code).

2. **Create a New File**:
    - Use the file explorer or the command palette (`Ctrl+P` or `Cmd+P`) to create a new file.
    - Name your file appropriately (e.g., `index.js`, `style.css`, `README.md`).

3. **Invoke Copilot**:
    - Start typing in your new file.
    - GitHub Copilot will suggest code snippets based on the context.

4. **Accept Suggestions**:
    - Use `Tab` to accept a suggestion.
    - Use `Ctrl+Space` to see more suggestions.

5. **Repeat for Additional Files**:
    - Create additional files as needed and repeat the process.

6. **Organize Your Files**:
    - Ensure your files are organized in directories as per your project structure.

Example:

```markdown
# Project Structure
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
```

By following these steps, you can efficiently create and populate multiple files in your project using GitHub Copilot.
