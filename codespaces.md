# Why Should I Use Codespaces?

## Use Cases with Objectives and Key Results

1. **Rapid Onboarding**
    - **Objective:** Reduce setup time for new developers.
    - **Key Result:** New developers can start coding within 5 minutes of joining.

2. **Consistent Development Environments**
    - **Objective:** Ensure all team members use the same development environment.
    - **Key Result:** Eliminate "works on my machine" issues by 100%.

3. **Remote Development**
    - **Objective:** Enable development from any location.
    - **Key Result:** Developers can work from any device with internet access.

4. **Resource Efficiency**
    - **Objective:** Optimize local machine resource usage.
    - **Key Result:** Offload heavy development tasks to cloud-based environments.

5. **Collaboration**
    - **Objective:** Facilitate real-time collaboration among team members.
    - **Key Result:** Multiple developers can work on the same codebase simultaneously.

6. **Security**
    - **Objective:** Enhance code security by keeping code off local machines.
    - **Key Result:** Reduce risk of code leaks by 90%.

7. **Scalability**
    - **Objective:** Scale development environments as needed.
    - **Key Result:** Instantly provision additional resources during peak times.

8. **Testing and Debugging**
    - **Objective:** Simplify testing and debugging processes.
    - **Key Result:** Reduce time spent on environment setup for testing by 80%.

9. **Integration with CI/CD**
    - **Objective:** Seamlessly integrate with continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
    - **Key Result:** Automate environment setup for CI/CD by 100%.

10. **Cost Management**
     - **Objective:** Manage development costs effectively.
     - **Key Result:** Pay only for the compute resources used, reducing overall costs by 30%.
